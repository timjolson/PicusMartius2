# Range of 20 seems to work for the cytron ESCs


The basic pulse unit is 100 micros long.

The final paramater in softPwmCreate says how long each cycle is in basic pulse units.

softPwmCreate(1,0,200) says create a cycle 20 ms long made up of 200 steps (20 ms as 200 * 100 = 20000 microseconds).

softPwmWrite(1,185) says keep the pulse high for 18.5 ms in every 20 ms cycle (18.5 ms as 185 * 100 = 18500 microseconds). That is way too long. Servos nominally respond to 1 ms - 2 ms pulses. So you should choose values 10 - 20.

softPwmCreate(1,0,500) says create a cycle 50 ms long made up of 500 steps.

softPwmWrite(1,14) says keep the pulse high for 1.4 ms in every 50 ms cycle. This will be close to the central position. A correct value would be 15 (again nominally values 10-20 should be used).

The 20 ms cycle is more correct for servos as it will give a nominal update of 50 Hz. A 50 ms cycle will only update at 20 Hz.
