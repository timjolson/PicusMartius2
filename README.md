# Recommended Python utilities
### Python3
For running on a full PC we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) since it includes many pre-setup packages.

For running on a single-board computer (raspberryPi, Odroid, etc.)
    
    apt-get install python3

Note that many SBC's come with python2, but [NIURoverTeam](https://github.com/NIURoverTeam) resources are based on python3.

### [Scite](http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html)
Light-weight, portable editor with syntax highlighting for multiple languages. Also executes scripts.

### [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
Large Editor/Interpreter/Debugger.

### [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) 
To write and execute small pieces of code, good for initial development. Anaconda installation includes Jupyter.

### [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/joystick.html)
For reading joysticks.
