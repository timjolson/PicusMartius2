## Installation:
  We recommend using Anaconda, a free collection of useful Python libraries. It saves you the time of isntalling the libraries separately and working around compatibility-type problems. 
  Notes: **Install Python v2.7.**
  **Allow Anaconda to create a PATH Variable during setup.**

  Additionally (after installing python), PyCharm, an editor and interpreter.

### Set Python Interpreter in PyCharm
  **For first run**
  1. On splash screen, select **Configure**, **Settings**.
  2. In left pane, go to **Project Interpreter**, in right pane use drop-down to select Python version/path.
  3. Click **OK** and the interpreter will be setup.
  
  **If you've run PyCharm already**
  
  Navigate to Settings to change for the current project, or Default Settings to set interpreter for any project or file you open.
  
  1.  File | Settings | Project:  PROJECTNAME | Project Interpreter

## Running a Script
### Scripts can be run in many ways:
